Hi there! I'm Ryan.

I study *how and why we vividly relive the past*, with a focus on intrusive memories. Chances are good that you remember your last birthday, vacation, or commute to work; but do you *relive* those events with vivid detail and feelings of being sent back in time? These subjective experiences have widespread consequences for mental function and dysfunction, yet little is known about how they arise in daily life. 

My research uses naturalistic, experimental, neuroimaging, and computational methods to investigate basic mechanisms of autobiographical memory and apply them towards understanding mental health disorders involving excessive reliving (e.g., PTSD). In particular, I use AI methods to model both subjective (e.g., emotion, visual imagery) and objective (e.g., content) memory features, relate them to real-life outcomes, and enable novel analyses at an unprecedented scope and scale.

Outside of research, I'm a fan of hipster music, hipster tabletop role-playing games, and insisting that I'm not actually a hipster.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
