This is a workshop that I've run in various capacities at the University of Waterloo, Rotman Research Institute, and BrainHack School. All content is subject to change!

## Workshop Overview: 
R can feel like dark sorcery. Formulae chained together by eldritch symbols, scripts shared in hushed tones. This workshop aims to demystify R by walking through some first steps of what R and RStudio are; good habits to keep your code clean; and best practices for wrangling and visualising your data. No prior experience with R or coding is necessary. While learning R may not always spark joy, it will be life-changing!

## Workshop Objectives: 
In taking this workshop, you’ll learn (1) first steps, like understanding an R project’s file structure and the anatomy of an R script, (2) good habits, like commenting and naming conventions, (3) best practices, like using the `tidyverse` and pipe notation.

## Attendee Requirements: 
Optional, but strongly recommended: Up-to-date version of R ([https://cloud.r-project.org/](https://cloud.r-project.org/)) and RStudio ([https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/))
