## Course Description
Questions to be addressed include: How is information encoded and retrieved? What types of memory exist? How can we measure these forms of memory? Why does forgetting occur? What biological changes accompany memory loss? Can memory impairments be rehabilitated?

There is also a lab component to this course. The goal of the lab component is to introduce students to OpenSesame software, which is often used to collect data for research studies. The goal for these labs is to give you a hands-on opportunity to understand the basic methods in current memory research.

Several major themes in the area of memory research are explored in this course. Historically influential ideas, current theoretical debates, and the application of cognitive, social, neuroimaging, & neuropsychological approaches to the study of memory are reviewed and discussed.

## Course Structure and Requirements
By the end of the course, you will have a detailed knowledge of a wide range of memory phenomena and a solid foundation from which to pursue more advanced study. The introduction to OpenSesame will familiarize you with how experiments are set up, and the variables that can be manipulated. Attendance at lectures and in labs is essential. Group Presentations are designed to promote discussion of relevant ideas and concepts. The poster session is designed to introduce you to how research results are communicated at scientific conferences and meetings.
