# GL-PSYC3390 (Memory), Winter 2025
Glendon Campus, York University

## Expanded course description: 
Why do we forget some things, while others last a lifetime? How do we learn? What types of memory exist? How can we measure these forms of memory? What biological changes accompany learning and memory loss? Can memory impairments be rehabilitated?

These are all important—and mostly unanswered—questions that reinforce how the human memory system has far-reaching impacts on our daily lives. This course will tackle these issues by exploring historically influential ideas, current theoretical debates, and the cognitive, neuroimaging, & neuropsychological methods which have formed the backbone of memory research. This course invites you to become part of the conversation, and decide for yourself how we can best understand memory.

## Course objectives and learning outcomes: 
By the end of the course, you will be able to identify and describe a wide range of memory phenomena. This includes being able to contextualize them within models and theories of memory, propose methods to study them, and generate new hypotheses about them. Finally, you will be able to critically evaluate claims, hypotheses, and theories of memory in both academic and real-world contexts.
