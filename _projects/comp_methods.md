As a proponent of the open science movement, open-source development is deeply important to me. My training as a cognitive neuroscientist informs my approach towards using and developing AI methods, in that fundamental principles of ethics, reproducibility, and replicability are more important than ever. To this end, I release all of my code and data openly, wherever ethically sound. 

Furthermore, an important cornerstone of my research is developing and validating novel methods that can enable/improve science at large. To this end, I have developed and validated novel AI/ML/NLP methods and subsequently released them fully open-source. For example, I have created a novel automated method for detecting invalid open-text responses based solely on the text response itself {% cite yeung2022machine %}. My current work also compares state-of-the-art transformer-based language models (e.g., DeBERTaV3) against simple ML algorithms, finding that while AI models offer benefits in some tasks (e.g., sentiment analysis, accuracy scoring), the costs sometimes outweigh the gains. In the future, my goal is to continue developing and validating methods that span not only cutting-edge AI techniques, but also classic, interpretable, and explicable ML techniques.
