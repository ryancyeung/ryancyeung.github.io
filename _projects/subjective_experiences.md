Unintentionally and repetitively remembering specific events is a hallmark feature of psychopathology, with theories claiming that they play a causal role in PTSD, depression, anxiety disorders, and more. However, emerging evidence suggests that intrusive memories are also exceedingly common in everyday life, even among individuals without any mental health disorders. If intrusive memories are not diagnostic of psychopathology, what is? Building upon core cognitive theories of memory, we know that the act of remembering is not necessarily the act of reliving. As such, the subjective experience (or phenomenology) of the memory may be key: complex, interrelated memory features such as vividness and emotional intensity may interact to produce adverse outcomes. My work leverages natural variance in these subjective experiences, both between memories and between individuals, to ask why intrusive memories develop and how they relate to one’s neurocognitive profile. Studying intrusive memories and their subjective experiences offers a rich testing ground for fundamental theories of autobiographical memory, while also providing important opportunities to improve clinical outcomes.

One line of my work has demonstrated large-scale, replicable evidence that subjective features of intrusive memories have real-world outcomes. For instance, negatively valenced intrusive memories are associated with greater symptoms of mental health disorders (e.g., PTSD, depression, social anxiety disorder; Yeung & Fernandes, 2020, 2021, 2023, 2024; Yeung et al., 2024), even at the subclinical level. Other subjective features of intrusive memories such as vividness and frequency of recurring have shown utility in diverse domains, such as predicting trait mind wandering {% cite yeung2024recurrent %} and differentiating between depression and boredom proneness {% cite yeung2024disentangling %}. 

I have recently extended this work by showing that the vividness and emotional intensity of involuntary memories predict disorder symptoms, whereas voluntary memories with similar phenomenology could not {% cite yeung2026voluntary %}. Altogether, my work has shown that intrusive memories are a general cognitive phenomenon with unique relationships with psychopathology that we would otherwise miss using traditional laboratory or voluntary memory paradigms.
