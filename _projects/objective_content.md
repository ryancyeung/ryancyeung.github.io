Another line of my work has followed up on these subjective differences by asking whether these intrusive memories also differ in terms of objective content. Potentially, individuals in clinical populations could have been exposed the exact same events as nonclinical individuals, yet have dramatically different subjective experiences (e.g., witnessing similarly severe events, but attributing much greater emotional intensity). To address this question, I have employed computational methods to examine objective content in intrusive memory narratives, being one of the first to publish articles on analyzing autobiographical memory content using AI/ML methods and openly releasing all associated code {% cite yeung2022machine yeung2022understanding %}.

For example, I have pioneered the use of techniques such as machine learning and natural language processing to enable large-scale analyses of what people actually report remembering, quantifying topics such as “family vacations”, “interpersonal relationship difficulties”, and “potentially traumatic events” as continuous variables in tens of thousands of written memory narratives. My work has shown that objective content still plays a significant role in predicting disorder symptoms, even after controlling for valence ratings {% cite yeung2022understanding yeung2023specific %}; for example, content about interpersonal relationship difficulties predicted more PTSD symptoms, regardless of one’s subjective valence rating. My research argues that both subjective and objective information about intrusive memories are necessary to predict their links to mental health.
